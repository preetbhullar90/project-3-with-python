## Introduction

This is my 3rd project at code institute. I developed hangman the word game, which runs in the python terminal and is deployed on Heroku, usually, this game is a 2-player game however, the version I have created is played between the user and computer. In this game, users guess the words by choosing letters. The user has 6 chances for selecting the wrong letter before the game is over. In the starting user sees a hangman image and 1 row of dashes. If the user guesses the correct letter of the word, then that letter will appear in the row of dashes, otherwise, users will lose 1 of their 6 chances and they will get the next hangman image. If users guess incorrectly 6 times, then they will lose all their chances and the game will be over. Users can play this game an unlimited amount of times.

### User Stories

#### New users :
* As a new player, I want this game to start easily.
* As a new player, I want to see the full instructions about how to play and what I need to do to continue.
* As a new player, I want to see the correct or incorrect selected letters in the terminal while playing.
* As a new player, I want this game to be challenging therefore I do not want access to the word list.
